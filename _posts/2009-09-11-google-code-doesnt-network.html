When I search for "pyopt" on google the first result is the PyPI page which is pretty amazing considering it didn't exist before a few hours. The google code page for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyopt/">pyopt</a> is nowhere to be seen, a search for "pyopt site:google.com" gives only some mathematical optimization module. Strange stuff google, strange. Maybe I should've went with <a href="http://github.com/">github</a>.

update 15-11-2009: now I do get the top ranking search result on google for pyopt but zero results on yahoo search's first page. Wtf is Peyote? So anyway the conclusion is it takes google at least a week to crawl google-code. Strange.
