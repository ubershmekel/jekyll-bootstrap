Out there in the wild internet there are many dark corridors and places we'll never be able to visit. Understandably. But on reddit?! I think the people deserve to at least vaguely know the inner workings of their contentocracy. Here's a list of a few most of us can only see the closed door of:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/lounge">http://www.reddit.com/r/lounge</a> - A secret community open to whoever has reddit gold or has the "Charter Member" trophy. I'd describe it as a monoclejerk.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/modtalk">http://www.reddit.com/r/modtalk</a> - ??? - Perhaps a secret community for mods to discuss mod stuff.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/redditcourt">http://www.reddit.com/r/redditcourt</a> - ??? - Perhaps a secret community for judging and punishing reddit outlaws? Who are the reddit lawyers? Where's reddit prison?</li>
	<li>What more is there underneath the surface?</li>
</ul>
What are we voting for? What's running this <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DGq2C.jpg">voting machine</a>?

&lt;/tinfoil_hat&gt;
