Just saw this gem on reddit: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9pd33/dear_redditpy_could_you_help_me_convince_myself/c0dt5wa">http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9pd33/dear_redditpy_could_you_help_me_convince_myself/c0dt5wa</a>

Also, good luck on implementing an http-proxy in PHP, the damn thing would have to be huge, ugly and would require at least one PEAR lib to do it the right way.

And for some reason <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/post-by-email/">wordpress post by e-mail</a> has a low google ranking, so I thought I should +1 that. Though I personally prefer a clunky interface to an ajax one any day.
