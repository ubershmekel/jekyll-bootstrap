Working on a project that needed some web scraping, I made <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/filecache">filecache</a>. I just wanted a simple decorator that would save the results of a function to disk. Memcache and other recipes seemed to be either overly complex or just plain memory caching (without persistence). If you want to help improve it then check out the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/filecache/">google code filecache project</a>.
