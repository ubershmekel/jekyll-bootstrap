tl;dr - add a "p" before the ".com" to any subreddit you visit and voila, you have a fullscreen presentation of all the images.

I like to show my friends cool stuff on the internet but browsing is a real conversation killer. You can't really lean back, talk and have fun with friends while operating a website, surely not one as clunky as reddit. Even though RES does help.

So I just had to make this "hands-free" reddit mode. Where I can see:
<ul>
	<li>Cats <a title="redditp slide show of aww" href="http://redditp.com/r/aww">http://redditp.com/r/aww</a></li>
	<li>Amazing views <a title="redditp presentation of earthporn" href="http://redditp.com/r/earthporn">http://redditp.com/r/earthporn</a></li>
	<li>Tempting dishes <a title="redditp presentation of foodporn" href="http://redditp.com/r/foodporn">http://redditp.com/r/foodporn</a></li>
	<li>Advice <a href="http://redditp.com/r/adviceanimals">http://redditp.com/r/adviceanimals</a></li>
	<li>*cough* other stuff</li>
</ul>
Easy!

Welp, not that easy, there was a lot of CSS to handle and the design right now is dead ugly but functional. Also, many stories on reddit aren't images and I skip those that aren't in a quirky way. If the url's 4th character from the right is a dot, I display it. That's a hack that works for imgur (which is most of reddit's images) so I'm using it for now until I have more time to fix it. Any suggestions are more than welcome - <a title="redditp on github" href="https://github.com/ubershmekel/redditp">help improve redditp on github</a>! Also, comics are a pain to watch right now. I might implement some sort of scroll wheel zooming in the future, though that really is a bit of a different use case that might deserve a different site.

I guess not too surprisingly the first 200 visits where mostly to gonewild. You internet you....

<strong>edit - </strong>here are some stats from the launch night
