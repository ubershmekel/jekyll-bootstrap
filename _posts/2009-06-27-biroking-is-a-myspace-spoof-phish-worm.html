I googled this and it appears no one noticed yet so I had to write about it specifically... biroking.com looks exactly like the myspace login. How does the phish work? Well all I know is i got a message that only had a link in it to biroking.com so I checked it and voila holy fuck. I assume that once they get your user/pass from the fake login they just message all your friends with nothing but www.biroking.com what assholes.
