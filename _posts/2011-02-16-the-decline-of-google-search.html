So I revealed <a href="http://python3wos.appspot.com">the python 3 wall of shame</a> a few days ago and immediately it was the best result in google when I searched for "python wall of shame" and "python3wos". Seems to make sense as there was no wall of shame for python yet. Now lets look at results 3 days later:

[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="307" caption="Search results for &quot;Python 3 Wall of Shame&quot;"]<a href="http://i.imgur.com/f91Uv.png"><img class=" " title="Search results for &quot;Python 3 Wall of Shame&quot;" src="http://i.imgur.com/f91Uv.png" alt="Search results for &quot;Python 3 Wall of Shame&quot;" width="307" height="270" /></a>[/caption]

You can see that on the first page of google results you can find a million references to the wall, but no links to the actual website or blog post. The same can be said about results for "python3wos" which isn't even a word but it's the subdomain of the site.

[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="267" caption="Search results for &quot;python3wos&quot;"]<a href="http://i.imgur.com/yo3f2.png"><img class=" " title="Search results for &quot;python3wos&quot;" src="http://i.imgur.com/yo3f2.png" alt="Search results for &quot;python3wos&quot;" width="267" height="284" /></a>[/caption]

It's not too bad since in most of these results the real website is just a click away. I just really don't understand what happened, maybe I did something wrong?. Anyhow, it's pretty obvious that all the kids are only using facebook to communicate nowadays. Soon they'll just feel comfy with facebook's bing search, a few years of that and the game will be over. Here's to hoping google sharpen their edge.

edit - a few hours after writing this article, the search "python 3 wall of shame" is now fixed, though "python3wos" still gets you only to links. Lets do an seo experiment, I'll add this linkÂ <a title="Python3wos Python 3 wall of shame" href="http://appspot.python3wos.com">python3wos</a> here and add the word "python3wos" on the wall.
