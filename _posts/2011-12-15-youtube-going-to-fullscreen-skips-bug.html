Whenever I switch between fullscreen and back in this video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOTPCaItx3w">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOTPCaItx3w</a> for example - youtube skips 2 seconds forward in time. Even while paused.

I found two relevant issues:

<a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/youtube/thread?tid=2960543d59021a08&amp;hl=en">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/youtube/thread?tid=2960543d59021a08&amp;hl=en</a>

<a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/youtube/thread?tid=134f7450b6d08d3c&amp;hl=en">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/youtube/thread?tid=134f7450b6d08d3c&amp;hl=en</a>

The first one suggests to disable flash's hardware acceleration which does work (right click the video and then click settings).

But why should we do that?

Also did I mention I dislike losing all the video I buffered in 360p when youtube auto-switches to 480p with fullscreen? I had to manually disable that too.

¯\_(ಠ_ಠ)_/¯
