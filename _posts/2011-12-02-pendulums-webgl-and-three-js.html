Here's the <a title="Waves Pendulum Simulation" href="http://toplessproductions.com/pendulum">waves pendulum three.js simulation</a> I made.
<div> So I wanted to simulate a <a title="Real Waves Pendulum" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVkdfJ9PkRQ">magical pendulum with waves</a> to prove my point that the shapes are the result of a dead simple arithmetic progression. I was almost correct.</div>
After testing, I saw that when the frequency is an arithmetic progression we get the awesome patterns. The problem is that achieving such a feat by modifying the length of the strings alone is a bit harder. Here's omega, or the angular frequency from <a title="hyperphysics - pendulum physics equations" href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/pend.html">hyperphysics</a>:

<img style="background:#FFF;" src="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/imgmec/pend5.gif" alt="w = sqrt(g/L)" />

So all I had to do was choose omegas, increment them and from that calculate the string lengths. I got mixed up and solved the problem in a much more <a title="python code which generates string lengths for wave pendulums" href="http://codepad.org/HiS4wJAL">complicated way</a>.

Anyhow, by faking it (choosing my omegas with bogus L's) I get a prettier result. Headache averted. I'm not sure these swing angles are simple pendulums anyway.

WebGL and three.js are indeed awesome. It does have its gotchas but I was just so impressed with <a title="Ellie Goulding Lights WebGL Video" href="http://lights.elliegoulding.com/">http://lights.elliegoulding.com/</a> and other things in the three.js gallery. It's amazing how simple and accessible opengl is now that it's in the browser. The "hello world" of about 20 lines for a rotating cube was good though I think it should include the <a title="Javascript WebGL detector class" href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/js/Detector.js">WebGL detection </a>in it.
