It's not as easy as I thought, most websites actually want you to e-mail them a phish report. Naturally, google did it almost right.

This is how you check if a site was reported or not (notice you have to modify the url to use this):
<a title="http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=http://biroking.com/" href="http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=http://biroking.com/"> http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=http://biroking.com/</a>

This is how you report phishers:
