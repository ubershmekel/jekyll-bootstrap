Been shopping for an internet connections recently?

I say we need 2 more metrics: average ping and GB per day (gaming and downloading movies).

1 Mbps = 10.5 GB per day

This means about 10 old movies (700 MB) per day, or 2 almost awesome 720p (4 GB), or 1 holy crap 1080p movie (8 GB).

Average ping should come from pings to 3-5 stable, well known, and geographically defined sites like: www.usa.gov, www.direct.gov.uk, www.government.gov.ru
