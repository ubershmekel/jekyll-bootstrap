I don't like wordpress taking ownership of links
<a href="http://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic/link-redirection-through-go2wordpresscom?replies=12#post-404181">http://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic/link-redirection-through-go2wordpresscom?replies=12#post-404181</a> so I'm breaking off. I use wordpress partly as a link pastebin and archive so not being able to just copy-n-paste links is a real deal breaker for me.

I wonder which of these links will be replaced into go2 jacked links: <a href="http://www.youtube.com">http://www.youtube.com</a>
<a href="http://www.cnn.com">http://www.cnn.com</a>
<a href="http://www.blizzard.com">http://www.blizzard.com</a>

Hurrah for the export/import tool.
