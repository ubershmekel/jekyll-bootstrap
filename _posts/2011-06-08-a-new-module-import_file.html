So I had this python web server and I wanted to write a script that does some maintenance. The problem was, if the maintenance script isn't part of the "__init__.py" package tree, it couldn't use any of the web server modules. A hacky way to get around this is to add the target module's directory to the path:
<pre>    import sys
    sys.path.append('/usr/wherever_that_module_is')
    import your_module</pre>
Another trick is using <code>os.chdir</code>. Even when importing modules from the same package things can become confusing as can be learned from <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0328/">PEP 328</a>, <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0366/">PEP 366</a>, an <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=import+file+python+site%3Astackoverflow.com">abundance of stackoverflow questions on the subject</a> and many more. I'd like to quote The Zen of Python:
<pre>    Simple is better than complex.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</pre>
I don't believe any of these can be said about python imports, at least not for anything past the trivial case of one-folder-with-all-the-modules. The moment you want to organize your project in folders it becomes complex if not complicated and unnatural.

"import math" just works and that's great, I just wished there was an equivalent to the banal:
<pre>#include "path/to/module"</pre>
From those inferior languages. So I wrote import_file which can be used like this:
<pre>    &gt;&gt;&gt;from import_file import import_file
    &gt;&gt;&gt;mylib = import_file('c:\\mylib.py')
    &gt;&gt;&gt;another = import_file('relative_subdir/another.py')</pre>
It's very similar to the imp module syntax, except the function requires one argument less. This is the way it should be imo.
