I still remember my 10th grade Biology teacher explaining that because blonde hair is a recessive trait it will slowly vanish off the face of the earth. Recently I read a news article with a similar claim, and had an argument with a few biology and genetics majors. So I wrote a simulation.

<a title="TraitSim" href="http://yuvalg.com/traitsim/">TraitSim</a> is an animated toy for exploring random, neutral gene proliferation with brown and blue eyes as an example. I also wrote a <a title="python simulation of genetic drift" href="https://github.com/ubershmekel/traitsim/blob/master/simulate.py">python version of the simulation</a> and ran it tens of thousands of times. Thanks <a title="PyPy" href="http://pypy.org/">pypy for the <strong>8.3x</strong> speedup</a>! Surprisingly the chance to win the gene-race is linear with the gene's initial prevalence as can be seen in the following graph thanks to <a title="Matplotlib" href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>.

The thing with dominance is that it affects the gene expression which can be seen in the following graph:

And here's <a title="graph generating source matplotlib" href="https://github.com/ubershmekel/traitsim/blob/master/graphs.py">the source that generated these from the data</a>. There's more information in the <a title="TraitSim Page" href="http://ubershmekel.github.com/traitsim/">project page on github</a>. These github pages are strange creatures which I'm not sure how to work with yet. Can I modify the CSS or structure somehow without losing the benefit of the page generator?
