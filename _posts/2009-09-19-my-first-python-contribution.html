This might be a bit silly, but I'm pretty proud of <a title="It's only an error message, but still..." href="http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Lib/inspect.py?r1=74285&amp;r2=74901">my first diff in the python trunk</a>. This is <a title="Maybe cfunctions should be treated better and given their own error message?" href="http://bugs.python.org/issue6905">the ticket</a> where all the magic happened.

I think I'm content. No need to be working too hard getting pyopt into the standard library, etc...
