I wanted to try out Django over App Engine so I made an online regular expressions evaluator:

At first I thought it's strange that there's no online python regular expression checker. This might not be surprising considering how easy it is to test stuff with the python interpreter as opposed to php which can be a PITA for just testing one or two lines. Either way I thought this might be useful for quick checks and as a teaching tool.
