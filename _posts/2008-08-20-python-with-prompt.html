Ever run a python script in windows and it just doesn't work and doesn't tell you why?

This is for when exceptions are thrown but Windows closes your python interpreter, I came up with a shell extension called "open with prompt" where the interpreter sticks around so you can toy around with your python script after it's done.

Just run this: <a title="registry file" href="http://www.fileqube.com/hl/KQqucDVqF85231/python with prompt.reg">[reg file]</a> (for python ver 2.5 installed in default location)<a title="registry file" href="http://www.fileqube.com/hl/KQqucDVqF85231/python with prompt.reg">
</a>

The reg file contains (it's really simple, just add -i to the regular running):
<blockquote>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Python.File\shell\Open with prompt]

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Python.File\shell\Open with prompt\command]
@="\"C:\\Python25\\python.exe\" -i \"%1\" %*"

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Python.File\shell\Open with prompt]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Python.File\shell\Open with prompt\command]
@="\"C:\\Python25\\python.exe\" -i \"%1\" %*"</blockquote>
