Drawing inspiration from this blog post on <a title="Are Your Titles Irresistibly Click Worthy &amp; Viral?!" href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/are-your-titles-irresistibly-click-worthy-viral">title virality</a> I wanted to investigate what makes these top 10,000 titles the best of their breed. Which are the best superlatives? Who/what's the most popular subject? Let's start with some statistics:
<ul>
	<li>On Feb. 03, 14:10:45 (UTC) the all-time top 10,000 submissions on reddit (/r/all) had a total of 82,751,429 upvotes and 62,655,532 downvotes (56.9% liked it).</li>
	<li>5.2 years between the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/oi65/poll_vote_up_if_you_are_male_ down_if_you_are/">oldest </a>and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/p8mo1/if_you_didnt_realize_how_large_wha les_were_already/">newest</a> submission</li>
	<li>8,331,382 comments. That's about 833 comments per submission.</li>
	<li>The <a title="test link" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/92dd8/test_post_please_ignore/">#1 post</a> has 26,758 - 4,882 = 21,876 points</li>
	<li>The <a title="dog oscar" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/opfm2/this_dog_deserves_an_oscar/">#10,000</a> post has 15,166 - 13,679 = 1,487 points</li>
	<li>And now some graphs....</li>
</ul>

<h2>Even NLTK doesn't understand these...</h2>
I'm pretty sure you don't need example links for these...

<h2>The top 10,000 seem to come mostly from 17:00 UTC and rarely from around 12:00 UTC</h2>
This isn't exactly the probability of succeeding to hit the front page as it's not clear at what time submission count is highest. But it's something.

<h2>An apology</h2>
This is my first time using NLTK and though I'm ok at coding I most certainly have no idea how to parse natural language. Here's hoping this was somewhat insightful.
