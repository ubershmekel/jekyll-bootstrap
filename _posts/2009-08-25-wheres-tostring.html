Why don't python integers have a smart toString method like java/javascript? It's easy to convert strings into numbers using int(str_whatever) or float(str_whatever) but to convert them back you have only the decimal system (using str(number) or "%d" % number). In case you want to convert to binary, base32, base36, base64, you're gonna have to write your own conversion function. Batteries included?

Use either:
