This bug popped up in a script of <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/import_file">mine</a>:

For Python 2:
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; os.path.abspath('.')
'C:\\Users\\yuv\\Desktop\\YuvDesktop\\??????'
&gt;&gt;&gt; os.path.abspath(u'.')
u'C:\\Users\\yuv\\Desktop\\YuvDesktop\\\u05d0\u05d1\u05d2\u05d3\u05d4\u05d5'</pre>
For Python 3:
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; os.path.abspath('.')
'C:\\Users\\yuv\\Desktop\\YuvDesktop\\\u05d0\u05d1\u05d2\u05d3\u05d4\u05d5'
&gt;&gt;&gt; os.path.abspath(b'.')
b'C:\\Users\\yuv\\Desktop\\YuvDesktop\\??????'</pre>
That odd set of question marks is a completely useless and invalid path in case you were wondering. The windows cmd prompt sometimes has question marks that aren't garbage, but I assure you, these are useless and wrong question marks.

The solution is to always use unicode strings with path functions. A bit of a pain. Am I the only one who thinks this is failing silently? I'll file it in the bug tracker and we'll see.
