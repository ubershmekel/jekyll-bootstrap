These have to be some of the most interesting things I've seen recently:
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/">The Computer Language Benchmarks Game</a> - compare how cpu, memory footprint and source size of all your favorite languages. Also tested is multi-core vs single core and 32 vs 64 bit.</li>
	<li><a href="http://gmarceau.qc.ca/blog/2009/05/speed-size-and-dependability-of.html">Meta analysis of the above game</a> - visualizes all of the data from the above benchmark. No ground breaking conclusions, but the graphs are very nice to look at.</li>
</ol>
It's really interesting to see this information so plainly so one could learn a few ball park performance coefficients. There are a few things that the benchmarks don't measure ie readability, richness of library, strength and size of the developer Â community, etc, but it's interesting none the less.
