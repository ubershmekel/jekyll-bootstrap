<p>There are many good and <a href="http://blog.ugorji.net/2011/09/google-app-engine-new-pricing-sucks.html">b</a>a<a href="http://blog.ugorji.net/2011/09/objective-gripes-with-new-google-app.html">d</a> <a href="http://3.14.by/en/read/why-google-appengine-sucks">th</a>in<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+app+engine+sucks">gs</a> about GAE but this issue with the new pricing is just strange in my eyes:</p><p><strong>Every paid app must pay google at least $9 each month regardless of usage.</strong></p><p>The main awesome thing about GAE has always been the pay-as-you-need pricing model. This concept is completely shattered now for a certain scale of apps. The <a title="Python 3 Wall Of Shame" href="http://python3wos.appspot.com">Python 3 Wall of Shame</a> needed a few extra DB writes to finish the day nicely which would have cost roughly 10 cents a day. But now google will be rounding that up to 30 cents a day.</p><p>Apps that grow to use $1 worth of quotas a month are much better off heading to some form of shared <a href="http://www.webfaction.com/services/hosting">hosting for $5.50</a> a month until they hit that $9 a month necessity. That's the case with the Python3WOS and another one of my apps. I can't move the wall of shame as I don't have the time to do the porting (locked in ಠ_ಠ), but that other app is simple enough. So google will never find out if it could have been an app that's actually worth $9 monthly.</p>
